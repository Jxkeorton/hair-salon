### Fonts 
I will be using google fonts for this project. I have chosen to focus on using only two fonts that compliment each other nicely.

1. Great Vibes
2. Montserrat

I may use multiple styles of the Montserrat font such as bold, semi-bold or italic to represent the visual importance of the text or to provide contrast if text is over an image.
