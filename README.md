### Fonts 
I will be using google fonts for this project. I have chosen to focus on using only two fonts that compliment each other nicely.

1. Great Vibes
2. Montserrat

I may use multiple styles of the Montserrat font such as bold, semi-bold or italic to represent the visual importance of the text or to provide contrast if text is over an image.

## Testing 

### Responsiveness
All pages underwent testing to verify their responsiveness across various screen sizes, starting from 320px and above, adhering to the [WCAG 2.1 Reflow criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html) for responsive design. This testing was conducted on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Opera browsers.

#### Testing Procedure:

1. Open the browser and navigate to [Garden Room Hair Salon](https://jxkeorton.github.io/hair-salon/).
2. Open the developer tools by right-clicking and selecting inspect.
3. Set the view to responsive mode and decrease the width to 320px.
4. Adjust the zoom level to 50%.
5. Click and drag the responsive window to its maximum width.

#### Expected Outcome:

The website should display responsiveness across all screen sizes without any pixelation or stretching of images. Horizontal scrolling should be absent, and no elements should overlap.

#### Observed Outcome:

The website performed as expected.

Additionally, the website was tested on IphoneX and no responsiveness issues were detected.
